Short Biography
------
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Data Science at HEC Montréal in 2024, earning the Best Thesis Award for my work on novelty and diversity of information in automatic summarization. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University and a researcher affiliated with MILA (Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute). My research centers on cultural creativity in large language models, where I explore concepts related to creativity—such as novelty, typicality, diversity, and surprise—and their impact on culture, creative industries, and the ethical dimensions of AI.

I am currently a member of the EQUAL Lab under the Supervision of Pr. Golnoosh Farnadi : [EQUAL Lab](https://gfarnadi.github.io/student.html)
