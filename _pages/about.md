Short Biography
------
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Data Science at HEC Montréal in 2024, earning the Best Thesis Award for my work on novelty and diversity of information in automatic summarization. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University and a researcher affiliated with MILA (Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute). My research centers on cultural creativity in large language models, where I explore concepts related to creativity—such as novelty, typicality, diversity, and surprise—and their impact on culture, creative industries, and the ethical dimensions of AI.

I am currently a member of the EQUAL Lab under the Supervision of Pr. Golnoosh Farnadi : [EQUAL Lab](https://gfarnadi.github.io/student.html)

On a more personal note, I'm a French citizen originally from the beautiful French Alps, near Grenoble. I moved to Canada in 2018 and have since made Montréal my home. I especially enjoy the city's vibrant lifestyle and, of course, its Sunday brunches! Outside of work, you'll often find me riding my bike, playing badminton, or making the most of winter with plenty of skiing.

I am passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration for research and I enjoy applying my expertise across a wide range of domains. 
My research experience spans creative and cultural industries, human resources, marketing, and AI for social good, often in partnership with both academic and industrial collaborators. 

Teching Statement
------
Searching actively for an assistant professor Position in Generative AI, NLP/LLMs, or responsible AI.

I aspire to be a collaborative, student-centered professor who bridges academic excellence with real-world industry experience. Drawing on my background in managing interdisciplinary teams and teaching applied NLP, I aim to provide students with a knowledge and understanding of foundational models and generative AI, preparing them for impactful careers while also fostering their ethical awareness. I'm particularly excited to contribute to both core computing courses and emerging topics, such as generative AI and fairness and ethics in AI.

EDI Statement
------
I am deeply committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion, grounded in a strong belief in human rights, cultural diversity, and social justice. These values have guided my personal and professional journey, shaping my choice of research projects and collaborations with organizations dedicated to ethical, inclusive, and socially responsible AI. I actively promote fairness, safety, and environmental sustainability in all aspects of my work.
